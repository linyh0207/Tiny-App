# TinyApp

## Problem Statement

As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

As a twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.



## Goal

This web app was built using Node. A HTTP server was created to handle requests from the browser (client).The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.
